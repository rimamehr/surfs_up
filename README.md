## Overview of the analysis:
On a trip to Oahu, Hawaii I decided to open up a surf and shake shop serving surf boads and ice cream. I pitched my original idea to an investor, W. Avy who loved the idea but had concerns about the weather fluctuations and wanted me to do some additional analysis on the weather data. My original analysis was to look at a full year of data so I showed precipitation trends for an entire year but added on to that analysis by futher drilling into the specifics. He wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

## Results of the Analysis:
   - From my analysis looking into the months of June and Dec, I concluded that there is not a lot of temp variation between both the months which is good for our surf shop. 
   - The average temp for June is 75F and for December its 71F which makes this location an idea spot for a surf and shake shop to do well year round.
