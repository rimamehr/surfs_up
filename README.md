## Overview of the analysis:
On a trip to Oahu, Hawaii I decided to open up a surf and shake shop serving surf boads and ice cream. I pitched my original idea to an investor, W. Avy who loved the idea but had concerns about the weather fluctuations and wanted me to do some additional analysis on the weather data. My original analysis was to look at a full year of data so I showed precipitation trends for an entire year but added on to that analysis by futher drilling into the specifics. He wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.
